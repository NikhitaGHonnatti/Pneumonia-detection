# Pneumonia-detection using Chest X-ray images in Deep Learning
The aim of the project is to build a model to detect and classify pneumonia from chest X-ray images taken from frontal views at high validation accuracy.

Chest X-ray image of a person with Pneumonia


The output is an array of two values 0 and 1 to predict normal and pneumonia images. The output is formatted into two columns. The first column is for Normal and the second column for Pneumonia. In order to verify whether the model predicted the classes properly, the Normal and the Pneumonia images are read by specifying the normal or pneumonia image paths respectively. The output is desired to be 1 under the Normal column and 0 under the Pneumonia column if Normal image path was read as an input and vice-versa when Pneumonia image path was read as an input.
